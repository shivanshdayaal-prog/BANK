Problem Statement

The objective is to develop a functional Python script that simulates a basic banking system. The system must maintain account records, process core financial transactions (deposit, withdrawal, balance check), and enforce a 4-digit PIN security layer for all sensitive user operations. 

Scope of the project

In-Scope: Core account management (operations on accounts), input validation, PIN authentication, and balance calculations.
Out-of-Scope: Data persistence (data is lost upon closing the script), networking, multi-user concurrency, detailed transaction logging, and advanced security features (like PIN hashing).

Target Users

The primary target users for this project are:
Students/Learners: Individuals studying Python programming, procedural logic, and basic data structures.
Educators: Teachers needing a simple, executable example of a stateful application demonstrating validation and function calls.

High-Level Features

Account Management: Full life-cycle management (Creation, Modification, Closure).
Transaction Processing: Reliable and accurate processing of Deposits and Withdrawals.
Secure Authentication: PIN-based access control for user transactions and password-based access for the Admin view.
